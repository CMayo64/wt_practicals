        <h3>Experience </h3>
        <p>Three years ago I volunteered for a local café 
           helping the homeless (café Imbizo), I did several 
           jobs there, I prepped all the food sometimes, I 
           washed up, watered and sometimes did deliveries to 
           nearby businesses.

        </p>
        <p>  I have also volunteered for my
            local Citizens Advice Burea (CAB), who are a charity
            that aim to give advice to anyone who needs it about 
            any subject. Whilst I was there I updated there computer
            systems and fixed broken computers for them. I also helped
            set up the charity's office phones so that they were able
            to take them home and work from home if they needed to.
