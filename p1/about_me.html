        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p>I was born in Portsmouth St Marys Hosiptal and now live
           in fareham. I went to primary and secondary school in 
           farnham but now go to Solent University in Southampton.
           I am currently studying Web Technologies in my course
           and am thouroughly enjoying it at the moment. I used to
           play rugby but had to stop in order to focus my attention
           on my education more.

        <h3>Experience </h3>
        <p>Three years ago I volunteered for a local café 
           helping the homeless (café Imbizo), I did several 
           jobs there, I prepped all the food sometimes, I 
           washed up, watered and sometimes did deliveries to 
           nearby businesses. I have also volunteered for my
           local Citizens Advice Burea (CAB), who are a charity
           that aim to give advice to anyone who needs it about 
           any subject. Whilst I was there I updated there computer
           systems and fixed broken computers for them. I also helped
           set up the charity's office phones so that they were able
           to take them home and work from home if they needed to.
